            <span><h1 class="heading"> Welcome to my blog. </h1></span>

            <span><div><h2 class="blogheading">Week 1</h2><div class="blogbackground"><p class="blogbody">I first set up my Github account in grade 10. My computer science teacher was really cool, and worked for Google on AI technology back before everyone was doing it. It was an awesome time, but going back to that account now was surreal because I forgot how dumb I was back in that time. I've changed the childish username and the old profile picture now, but I've never felt more disappointment in myself than when I saw I had a Donald Trump Pepe profile picture. My politics even at the time didn't reflect that image (not that a fifteen year old knows anything about politics), but still it's interesting to see that I didn't yet have the media literacy to understand that I was going around with what is basically one step away from just putting up a swastika as my profile picture. Besides that, I'm also still on a repository with my old classmate Arnold, which was a funny reminder that he exists. I hope he's doing well. Anyways, I've re-set up the Git account to better reflect who I am now and so that I can use it in a slightly more academic setting.<br><br>

                Aside from my Git experience, I also did a lot of the readings last week. As someone with a passion for computer science, I've absolutely loved looking at these readings. I had a morning where I had to wait for a long while with nothing but Ulwazi to keep me entertained, so I've read the Bush, Turing, Englebart and Nelson.<br><br>
                
                The most fascinating insight I got out of the readings was with Nelson's "Proposal for a Universal Publishing System and Archive". Not so much because of the reading itself, but because of a modern parallel that I think is worth bringing up for discussion. In Nelson's reading, he proposes a vision of an idea that would one day go on to change the world, but because of the restrictions he places on it and the possessive control he wanted placed over the idea, his vision never came to pass. That reminds me of something else in the modern day: Facebook's metaverse. Much like Nelson's Xanadu, Facebook's idea for an immersive VR social space does have the potential to enrich society. A place where people can be anyone, go anywhere and learn anything as if they were practically there does sound great, but Facebook's vision is flawed because they're trying to build it as a system that they solely run and profit from, as opposed to a democratized system in which anyone can carve out a slice that is truly their own. And much like Nelson's system, I believe Facebook's plan is destined for failure, doomed to be replaced by a system that puts power into the hands of the individuals instead of accumulating it under the control of a single dystopian company that controls information on a far greater scale than any other power on earth.<br><br>
                
                I also think whatever that platform is will launch with the capacity for users to have legs.</p></div>
            </div><div><h2 class="blogheading">Week 2</h2><div class="blogbackground"><p class="blogbody">My main focus this week was on the website itself, since I did a lot of readings last week. I got started, and built a small prototype using some resources I found online to give me a bit of guidance, but to be honest, it was disorientating.<br><br>

                Because of the protests, I missed the Wednesday class last week, and even though I know that Wednesday is largely theoretical, it still felt like I had missed something important. But I didn't let that slow me down too much in the end, and so I got to work trying to build a basic prototype. That process really had me feeling what someone -Kieran, I think- said about how scary it is to do something with no direction. All the endless possibilities stretched out before me, and I had to decide what to do with them.<br><br>
                
                Ultimately, the web prototype I built was mainly built around the "The Missile Knows Where It Is, Because It Knows Where It Isn't" meme. It's stupid, I know, but I find it a lot easier to work when I latch onto something funny to put at the center of my work. It gives me a guideline, and that's really all I need a lot of the time. Of course, there is a major downside, and that is how I'll have to restart the page mostly from scratch once I eventually start getting it ready for a proper version I can submit. However, I don't think that's the end of the world, and I'm sure that the original page will live on as an easter egg in the site somewhere.<br><br>
                
                Besides getting started with my website, I also took a look at the HTML readings, namely the first two Bruce Lawson readings. They were a little hard to follow since HTML is so new to me (I've only ever dabbled into it lightly once before) but I think that they serve as nice resources, and it will be nice to know they exist so I can go back in future.</p></div>
            </div></div><div><h2 class="blogheading">Week 3</h2><div class="blogbackground"><p class="blogbody">Aw hell naw he lost his week 3 blog. But now I need to make this longer so it's aesthetically pleasing until I put the whole thing in.</p></div>
            </div><div><h2 class="blogheading">Week 4</h2><div class="blogbackground"><p class="blogbody">Convention is a funny thing. I mean, where did the way we start our blogposts come from? We all use the same format, yet it was never prescribed to us. We didn't get it from a reading, or from any kind of brief, someone just started using it and we all started following it.<br><br>

                Whenever discussions of convention come up for me, I can't help but think of the "first napkin" speech from Jojo's bizarre adventure. It's a lot of rambling in a typical anime villain nonsense speech, but what does stick with me is the idea that the person who determines convention is the first person who has the will to act. In other words, the person who "takes the first napkin" at a table is the one who determines which napkin belongs to who. And you can see that principle at play in a lot of places. Why do we put most of our navigation menus on top of the web page? Why do we drive on the left or right side of the road? Why do we read left to right, top to bottom, especially when some cultures read right to left instead? Simply, a lot of it just comes down to whoever had the chance to decide on the convention.<br><br>
                
                That said, not every convention is just because someone started doing it and everyone else did the same. Take the "There are bad Doors everywhere" reading, for example. There are "correct", intuitive ways to make doors work, and that goes for a lot of other things as well. A button with an arrow pointing up should not take you to the bottom of the page, and at this point we are probably settled enough with the idea of the "X" button closing programs that it shouldn't be changed to make them full screen.<br><br>
                
                So I guess what I'm getting at is that convention is a funny thing. It's weird and fluid, but at the same time strangely fixed. Sometimes it comes from someone taking that first napkin, that big leap, and other times it comes from somewhere deep in the human psyche. Some deep fixed understanding that a door with a handle is a pull door, or some such like that. Convention is a complex beast, and it's our job to wrangle it.</p></div>

            <div><h2 class="blogheading">Week 5</h2><div class="blogbackground"><p class="blogbody">We haven’t had a prompt for this week, so I’m kind of flying blind here. Forgive me if this is a bit rough.<br><br>
                This week has marked the official start on my website. I figured it was about time to actually get something down in code, because I learnt the hard way in recent Game Design assignment how much a single code mess up can keep you busy. Seriously, I ended up spending eight hours on that game and of that about three were trying to finish one system, which didn’t even get fixed fully. So that sucked, but I’m learning from it and I’m starting this assignment nice and early. A page a day is my current goal, and at this rate I’ll easily be done with everything with time to spare for fixing any screw ups and making the whole thing look even better wherever possible.<br><br>
                This is where I would talk about the readings, but those have all been pushed up to next week so instead I want to talk about this flu, and covid trauma. It’s crazy, right? For me as someone who really did not cope over covid (it came right as I was finally ready to stop being inside so much, so not good at all) I get deeply afraid the moment a lot of people start getting sick. I know I probably shouldn’t, since I doubt anyone is willing to repeat the sheer economic sledgehammer that was lockdown over some slightly more intense flu strain, but Covid affected us all in weird ways and for me it’s made me scared of having to spend time at home against my will, because I feel like everything that happened to me in the past four years is starting all over again. <br><br>
                Weird tangent, I know, but it’s what’s on my mind at the moment, and honestly what else is this blog for if not intelligently discussing what I’m currently thinking about.
                </p></div>
            </div>
            <div><h2 class="blogheading">Week 6</h2><div class="blogbackground"><p class="blogbody">
                I am so tired today. And I shouldn’t be, I mean I’ve had all of Sunday to relax and we’re winding down after a short, easy first block for the second block now (if I’m not mistaken) so I really shouldn’t be this tired. And yet I am. I’m so tired that I would rather talk about being tired than getting started on my website this week, because I think it’s interesting that I am tired.<br><br>
                I think it all comes down to Covid, as it always does. During Covid, and even before in my case, I got used to only really doing something of note maybe two, three days a week? And it was violently depressing, don’t get me wrong. I think my mental state has been a lot better not that I’m actually going out into the world and interacting with things, but I’m also a lot more tired, and I think it’s because I don’t have two to three days to recover from every social interaction anymore (except for when I do) and so my body is taking a long time to adjust. There’s almost certainly an extrovert aspect to it as well. I personally fall into the category of people who love socializing and spending time with people, but I’m also drained by it. It doesn’t relax me at all, unless it’s online. So now that I’m always finding chances to interact with people, I’ve been a lot more tired. It’s weird and funny, but yeah. I guess the last thing I’ll add is that I’m very much looking forward to the big social event on wednesday. It’s going to be so nice to finally see everyone in one place, I can’t wait.

            <div><h2 class="blogheading">Week 7</h2><div class="blogbackground"><p class="blogbody">
                So the funny thing about this blog post is that as soon as I'm done writing it, it'll go up on my website. Yes, my website is coming along! I've finally gotten over that first big hurdle when you learn a new skill when it comes to webdev, so now I'm good enough I can do things but not so good I expect to do them well. So everything is fun and exciting and I'm just having a ball putting together everything for my site. It is excellent. Just touch wood it stays that way.<br><br>
                Now then, for the quick IxD checkup on how I'm doing:<br><br>
                Goal Alignment: Not a deep topic right now. All I need is a site that's easy to navigate at the moment, all the manipulation and mind games will come later.<br><br>
                Information structure: This one has been a big deal. I've been putting a big emphasis on making sure things aren't cluttered, with the goal of keeping the site easy to navigate. It's hard work, especially with how much CSS is involved, but it's better to keep on top of it as you go -I think- so that you don't need to go back sort through the mess you made after you forgot your plans for it.<br><br>
                User flow: This is something I'm keeping in consideration, so far, but one I could probably try map a little more. The main thing I'm doing towards this end is keeping a top bar with all the main pages accessible at all times, which should make the site relatively easy and consistent to maintain. It does follow the three click rule so far, which is a major win.<br><br>
                Interface elements: This has been a more organic area. I started by just putting down whatever, but as the site has gone along, I've improved the weak areas and started to form a convention in others. I don't think you always need to stick to "best practice" dogmatically, but any time you do deviate from it then it's important to stay consistent in that deviation.<br><br>
                Design: My design documents are taking shape as I learn, but when they're done I'll put them in the Design section of my site, and update anything that's below the standards they set.<br><br>
                Implementation: My website has largely been simple so far, but I'm also trying to do a lot with that little. That means striking visuals and complete functionality wherever possible, so that I can represent a more complete design.<br><br>
                Reading: This weeks reading is essentially an exercise in quantifying experiential information. That's why it doesn't speak to me. I personally prefer to keep my sciences in science and my art in art, teasing out experiential information and working based on feel, rather than data. That's not to say there's no place for data in art, especially in web design, which blends the lines of science and art so much, but I prefer to use that data to improve what I design through feel, rather than creating sterile feeling products by designing using data. Again, just personal preference, but I'm trying to be the change I want to see in the world.
